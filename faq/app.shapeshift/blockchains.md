description: A list of the Blockchains that ShapeShift currently supports
---

# ⛓ Blockchains

A [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.

## Currently ShapeShift supports 12 different chains.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

### Bitcoin

[Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp) is a [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp), a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.

### Dogecoin

At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes.

### Litecoin

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Litecoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Litecoin features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, trade volume and liquidity, Litecoin is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.

### Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.

### Cosmos

Cosmos is an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services, built for a decentralized future. Cosmos apps and services connect using IBC, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol. This innovation enables you to freely exchange assets and data across sovereign, decentralized blockchains.

### Avalanche

Avalanche is an open, programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications. Build fast, low cost, Solidity-compatible dApps. Launch customized blockchains, private & public. Scale to millions of validators with minimal hardware.

### Thorchain

[THORChain](https://twitter.com/thorchain) is a multi-chain decentralised exchange ([DEX)](https://www.xdefi.io/article/dex-decentralised-exchanges/) that aims to solve one of the largest issues plaguing the blockchain space: fragmented liquidity spread across different chains. THORChain is a [Cosmos-based protocol](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) that allows users to exchange and earn a yield on Layer-1 (native) cryptocurrencies across different blockchains ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/), [DOGE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/), [BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/), [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/) currently) without going through a centralized exchange. Since the protocol is chain-agnostic, any new native asset can be added to the DEX in future upgrades if there is support for its addition to THORChain.

### Osmosis

Osmosis is a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-exchange-crypto-dex) and [automated market maker (AMM)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers) protocol for the [Cosmos ecosystem](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/cosmos-crypto-network-internet-of-blockchains). To understand the specifics of Osmosis, it’s helpful for you to know the context of the Cosmos ecosystem upon which and for which it is built. Cosmos is an overarching ecosystem of blockchain networks that can connect with one another as part of Cosmos’ mission to build an “internet of blockchains.

Osmosis is a DEX protocol, which means it uses [smart contracts](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-smart-contracts-explained) to determine the price of digital assets, to produce [liquidity](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-liquidity-bid-ask-spread-slippage) via a peer-to-peer (P2P) methodology, and to exact trades between users.

### Optimism

Optimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers. Built as a minimal extension to existing Ethereum software, Optimism’s EVM-equivalent architecture scales your Ethereum apps without surprises. If it works on Ethereum, it works on Optimism at a fraction of the cost.

### BNB Smart Chain

Launched by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), previously Binance Smart Chain, supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). BSC runs alongside the BNB Chain, previously Binance Chain. This dual-chain architecture will empower its users to build their decentralized apps and digital assets on one blockchain and take advantage of the fast trading to exchange on the other.

### Polygon

Polygon is the most proven way to build and scale your projects on Ethereum, the world's largest blockchain ecosystem. Polygon's native token is named MATIC. Polygon, formerly known as Matic network, provides an easy framework for new and existing blockchain projects to build on Ethereum without scalability issues. Using Polygon, users can interact with any[ decentralized application](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications) (DApp) without ever having to worry about network congestion.

### Gnosis

Gnosis Chain is one of the first Ethereum sidechains and has stayed true to its values.

By allowing contributors around the globe to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain is secured by over 120k validators. Its diverse validator set and the community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a much lower price point than mainnet.

Gnosis Chain is EVM-based and secured by at-home stakers around the world. Gnosis has all the tooling you are used to and trustless bridges to mainnet soon.
