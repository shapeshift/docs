### **How Do I Connect My Trezor to ShapeShift?**

**NOTE**: It’s important to update your Trezor’s firmware whenever a newer version is available. Be sure to have your recovery sentence before the initiation of any updates.

Once you know your Trezor’s firmware is up-to-date, it’s time to get started. First, head to beta.shapeshift.com. If you have not connected a wallet previously, the dashboard should prompt you to “Create or connect a wallet”. Make sure your Trezor is plugged in and click the Trezor logo.

A new tab will open prompting you to enter your PIN. Use the cipher to enter your PIN and click “Confirm”.
