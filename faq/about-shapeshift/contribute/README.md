# 🔄 Contribute

Part of being a Decentralized Global organization is providing the ability to empower our community to become involved and continue to offer valued contributions to the organization. This can be provided in a few different ways and can include different forms and levels of involvement.

In our DAO the ways to become a community member can be as simple as owning our governance token FOX or joining our Discord server. Becoming a contributor within the community has a few more options and opportunities depending on interests and community needs.

## Different forms of DAO contributions

### Governance&#x20;

Be the change that you are looking for, have an idea? Check out our governance process and learn how you can formulate that idea into a community discussion and develop a proposal that can be voted on by the FOX holders.
