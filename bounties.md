# Bounties

We :blue_heart: open source. It is a critical part of our mission to build a community-owned, 
free to use, interface into the defi universe. In order for us to realize this mission we need contributors like
yourself to come along on this journey. Bounties are a great way to get involved in our growing 
community of open-source developers.

The Shapeshift DAO has many flavors of bounties, but most of our engineering bounties are small 
features, improvements or bug fixes that can be made in a single Pull Request by a contributor.
These bounties are attached to issues in GithHub, and we use [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) as an 
incentivization layer. This mean's that contributors are rewarded in FOX, our governance token,
and become owners of the very platform they are helping to build.

#### Resources for new contributors and bounty hunters

We are at the start of building out more resources for contributors. If you are unable to find what you need please feel free to ask questions in our #engineering-public [Discord](https://discord.gg/shapeshift) channel. If it's over the weekend it may take us a bit to respond, but we will get to your question. If you ask a question and get a good answer consider adding it to the [FAQs](faq.md) here.
 
Additionally, feel free to attend Engineering Stand-up Every Weekday 17:00 UTC in [Discord](https://discord.gg/shapeshift) #Standup-AllAccess. You can introduce yourself, and we can often find someone to pair up with you if you need assistance for a few minutes after the meeting.
