# 📖 Ledger

**NOTE**: It’s important to update your Ledger's firmware whenever a newer version is available. Be sure to have your recovery sentence before the initiation of any updates.

**Important: Make sure you have Ledger Live downloaded before attempting to connect your Ledger to the ShapeShift platform. Instructions on how to do so can be found** [**here**](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download)**.**

Before you get started, please note the following:

* There is no BCH support at this time.
* We offer BTC SegWit support.
* ETH/ERC 20s support Account #0 only.
* There are multiple accounts for UTXO assets (BTC, LTC, DASH).

### **How Do I Connect My Ledger to ShapeShift?**

1\. To start, head to beta.shapeshift.com. If you have not connected a wallet previously, the dashboard should prompt you to “Create or connect a wallet”. Make sure your Ledger is plugged in and your PIN has been entered. Then, click “Pair” next to the Ledger logo.

Note: If you’ve previously connected another wallet to ShapeShift, click the drop down menu at the top right of the page and select “Switch Wallet”. Confirm that you’d like to switch wallets and then select “Ledger” from the list of wallets to connect.

2\. After clicking “Pair”, you will see a popup saying that beta.shapeshift.com wants to connect to your device.

Click “I’ll do this later” if you want to manually add accounts once you get to the assets page (click the asset you’d like to add then select “Add Account”).
