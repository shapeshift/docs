# ♨ KeepKey Privacy Policy

**Online Privacy Notice**

Data protection and security are important to Key Hodlers, LLC (“KeepKey”; “we”), as is your trust in our company and services. KeepKey is committed to processing your personal data responsibly and in compliance with legal requirements.

This Online Privacy Notice describes how we collect and process your personal data when you use our website https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/ (including any sub-sites and related extensions thereof; “the website”).

**Personal data we collect and process in order to make the website available**

You can visit the website and obtain information about our services without telling us who you are. As with any connection with a webserver, however, the server on which we host the website automatically logs and temporarily stores certain technical data.

Technical data that is stored includes the IP address and operating system of your device, the data and time of access, or the type of browser you use to access the website. This is required for technical reasons to make the website available to you. To the extent we, thereby, process personal data, we do so based on our legitimate interest to bring you the best possible user experience and to safeguard the security and stability of our systems.

Our website uses fonts by Google LLC (“Google”) (“Google Fonts”). To integrate Google Fonts into the website, your browser establishes a connection to the Google server. In doing so, the IP address of your device is transmitted to Google. Google logs records of font queries and protects this data from unauthorized access. Google analyzes aggregated data to optimize Google Fonts and identify which websites use Google Fonts. Further information on Google Fonts can be found here: https://fonts.google.com. Further information on how Google handles personal data can be found here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

**Personal data we collect and process to provide services to you and to respond to your inquiries**

If you interact with order or inquiry forms on the website (e.g. purchasing a KeepKey device or requesting support regarding a device), we will collect the information that you provide to us. We collect and process this personal data for the purpose of providing products and services, as well as information about our products and services to you.

This may include your full name, your shipping and billing address, your phone number, your e-mail address, and your credit card information.

Where such processing of your personal data is not strictly necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you or to comply with legal requirements, we will use this personal data based on our legitimate interest to respond to your inquiry, to contact you if we have any questions about your inquiry, to follow up on your inquiry, to process your orders, to develop, enhance and improve our products and services, to bring you the best possible experience or to safeguard the security and stability of our services. Further, based on our legitimate interest to inform our customers and partners about new developments, products, services or offers, we will send you certain commercial information (e.g. our newsletter or blog posts). However, you may at any time opt-out of receiving such information.

If you download and interact with the KeepKey client on Google Chrome, we will collect and process your device’s xpub data. This data is necessary to provide the services of the KeepKey client and will always be stored securely. We also use the services of BlockCypher for certain indexing requirements.
