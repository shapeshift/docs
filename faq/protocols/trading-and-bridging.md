# 🧱 Trading & Bridging

A list of all our available Trading and Bridging capabilities

### 0x

0x is an open-source, decentralized exchange infrastructure that enables the exchange of tokenized assets on multiple blockchains.\
\
The 0x protocol is, at its core, a set of secure smart contracts that facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)-based assets. The protocol serves as an open standard and common building block for any developer needing exchange functionality.\
\
In addition to the externally-audited smart contracts, 0x also offers developer tools tailored to the ecosystem and open-access to a pool of shared liquidity.

Developers can integrate with 0x at the smart contract or application layer.\
\
The diagram below shows an overview of the 0x ecosystem, which includes applications who provide liquidity (supply), applications who consume liquidity (demand), and the multiple supported blockchains.

### CoW Swap

[CoW Swap](https://cowswap.exchange/#/faq?chain=mainnet) is the first trading interface built on top of CoW Protocol.

CoW Swap is a Meta DEX aggregator that allows you to buy and sell tokens using gasless orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users, or into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection.

### THORSwap

[THORSwap](https://thorswap.finance/) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that supports multiple blockchains by utilizing the THORChain network. THORSwap acts as a front-end user interface to perform cross-chain swaps done in a permissionless, trustless, and non-custodial manner.

### Osmosis

Osmosis is an advanced automated market maker (AMM) protocol that allows developers to build customized AMMs with sovereign liquidity pools. Built using the Cosmos SDK, Osmosis utilizes Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) to enable cross-chain transactions.

Osmosis allows users to launch liquidity pools with unique parameters, like bonding curves and multi-weighted asset pools. The incentive structure of Osmosis is also adaptable. Governance implements liquidity reward (LP) rewards for specific pools, allowing for strategically targeted incentives.

### Cosmos

The Cosmos SDK (opens new window) is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as **application-specific blockchains**.

### LI.FI

LI.FI has built a middle layer between DeFi infrastructure and the dApp layer. It is the ultimate gateway to any swapping and bridging available today. LI.FI Bridge & DEX Aggregation Protocol gives you access to all Bridges and DEXs, both on- and cross-chain.

**One SDK to get you multi-chain**&#x20;

LI.FI offers on-chain swaps, cross-chain swaps and a combination of both. It aggregates all the bridges, DEXs and DEX aggregators so you don't have to.

So far ShapeShift has been able to implement LI.FI bridging between EVM Chains. Bridging between various other chains is expected to come in the future, so stay tuned!
