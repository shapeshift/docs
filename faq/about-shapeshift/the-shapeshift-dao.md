# 🔮 The ShapeShift DAO

### The Seeds

The former ShapeShiftAG organization made the first official documented transition from an existing traditional corporate organization to a DAO. To assist in these efforts one of the largest airdrops up to this point in crypto was rolled out over 1 million plus addresses, and a structured process of dissolving the existing corporate structure began. With the official documented start date of July 14, 2021 ShapeShift set out to attempt something new and innovative in the business world.
